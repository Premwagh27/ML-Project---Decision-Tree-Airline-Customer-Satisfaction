# ML-Project---Decision-Tree-Airline-Customer-Satisfaction
Project Description:

In this particular project, we are using a dataset that contains information like, Gender, Customer_Type, Age, Type_of_Travel, Class etc and using that to predict the customer satisfaction level. 
However, before you go ahead and make a prediction, it is advised that you first pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise. 
In addition, try various tricks and techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions.

Part-1: Data Exploration and Pre-processing

1) load the given dataset 
2) print all the column names 
3) describe the data 
4) Drop the column ‘Unnamed’ 
5) Replace all the “ “ in column with “_” 
6) Give label to a satisfaction column value without using any encoding method 
7) Plot the number of satisfied customers and the number of unsatisfied customers 
8) find the mean value of satisfaction of male and female customers 
9) find the mean value of satisfaction of customers with respect to Age.
10) find the mean value of satisfaction of customers with respect to Food_and_drink.
11) Display a boxplot for Flight_Distance 
12) Display a boxplot for Checkin_service 
13) Find all the Null values 
14) Drop all the na values 
15) Find the unique values in Flight_Distance

Part-2: Working with models 

1) Perform encoding in columns Gender, Customer_Type, Type_of_Travel, and Class. 
2) Drop the column id and unnamed:_0.1
3) Create the features and target Data 
4) Perform scaling on features data 
5) Split the data in training and testing sets 
6) Fit the decision tree model with various parameters 
7) Create a function to display precision score, recall score, accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, F1 Score.
